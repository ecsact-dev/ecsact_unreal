# Ecsact Unreal Integration

:warning: under heavy development

## Install

The Ecsact Unreal Integration is **not** available in the unreal marketplace as of yet. Instead we recommend adding a git submodule in your `Plugins` directory.

```bash
# make sure to CD into your project folder that contains your .uproject
cd path/to/your/project/root

# add ecsact integration as a submodule in Plugins/Ecsact
git submodule add https://github.com/ecsact-dev/ecsact_unreal Plugins/Ecsact
```
